Mie Scattering simulation of micro spheres in python

This project contains two sub projects:

1. Forward Mie scattering problem, which generates the simulations of an electromagnitic field at any given plane
and any parameters given by the user.

2. Inverse Mie problem, which solves the linear system from the field generated by the forward model to get the
corresponding parameters.
